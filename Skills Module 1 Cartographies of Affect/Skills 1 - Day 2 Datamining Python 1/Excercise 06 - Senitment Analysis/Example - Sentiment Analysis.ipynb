    "VADER is a lexicon and rule-based sentiment analysis tool specifically tuned for social media and short, informal text. It returns a dictionary of scores: 'neg', 'neu', 'pos', and 'compound' (a normalized, weighted composite score).\n",
    "\n",
    "Pros:\n",
    "- Works well on short sentences, tweets and informal text\n",
    "- Fast and requires no training\n",
    "- Interpretable scores (compound between -1 and +1)\n",
    "\n",
    "Cons:\n",
    "- Rule-based and lexicon-limited: may miss complex sarcasm or deep contextual cues\n",
    "- Domain mismatch if your text is very different from social media language\n",
    "\n",
    "When to use: quick baselines, exploratory analysis, or when labeled data is not available. For higher accuracy on domain-specific data, consider fine-tuning a transformer model.\n",
