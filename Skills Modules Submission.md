# SKILLS MODULES - SUBMISSION

## DELIVERABLES
- Each student must submit their **own work**.
- Submit a **single PDF file (max 10 MB/15 pages)**. This PDF should include your answers to the three workshop assignments, i.e. 5 pages per workshop. 
- Also, put your code into a **GitHub repository**. The pdf should link or refernce to certain part on github. Use jupyter notbook format if appropiate. 
- Supporting materials on github can include: code, Grasshopper files, datasets, videos, source files, and even failed tests (if they’re interesting).
- Clearly label which parts of the PDF and GitHub correspond to each of the three workshop assignments.
- The PDF should focus on explaining your process and answers, with links to relevant files on GitHub. Avoid adding too much code directly in the PDF.
- Include a bibliography at the end of the PDF with all your references.
- Use a consistent referencing style for all external sources (websites, books, YouTube tutorials, GitHub pages, etc.).

## FILE NAMING
- Keep submissions anonymous. Use only your **Cluster Number** and **Student Number** on the cover page.  
  Example: `RC15_4232422`
- For GitHub, your username should be your student number, and the repository name should be your RC followed by your student number (e.g., `RC15_4232422`). If you already have a GitHub account, rename it or create a new one with your student number as the username. Files inside the folder don’t need a specific format.

## FINAL SUBMISSION DEADLINE
**Skills Final Submission**:  

<b style="color:red;">**6th of May 2025 at 12:00 pm**</b>	

  Submissions will open a few days before the deadline. Late submissions will face penalties.

# Skills Module 1 - HACKING THE IOT

## OUTLINE
This module is about creating a wearable device that sits between you and the city around you. We’ll use small computers called microcontrollers and Arduino to build sensors and devices that can talk to each other. GPS will help track where and when things happen, and we can save this data or send it to a computer. We’ll also learn how to show this data in programs like Rhino and Grasshopper.

## LEARNING CONTENT
- Basics of Arduino: how it works, the parts of an Arduino Uno board, and how to program it.
- Introduction to common sensors like GPS, GSR (skin response), and air quality sensors. We’ll learn how they work and how to record their data.
- Building a data logger: a device that collects data from sensors, saves it to an SD card, and records the time and location.
- Connecting the data logger to a computer and showing the data in real-time using vvvv.
- Visualizing the data in Rhino and Grasshopper.

## ASSIGNMENT
Create a technical report for the wearable device you designed in Term 1. Explain how it works, show the code and hardware setup, and display the results using maps and diagrams.

# Skills Module 2 - REPRESENTING CITY DYNAMICS

## OUTLINE
This workshop series teaches how to create and work with 3D maps of cities. We’ll learn how to visualize, edit, and analyze 3D models made from point clouds (3D data points). We’ll explore different ways to create 3D scans, like using AI (Nerfs and Gaussian splatting), basic photogrammetry with smartphones, and professional 3D scanners. We’ll also use Rhino/Grasshopper to visualize data and run simulations.

## LEARNING CONTENT
- Introduction to Python, which is used for many of the techniques in the course.
- Using software like Postshot to create point clouds and animations from real-world scans.
- Exploring AI tools like MidJourney, Luma, and Krea to generate images and animations.
- Editing point clouds with tools like Meshlab and Rhino.

## ASSIGNMENT
Create and visualize a 3D point cloud. This can be a real-world scan, an AI-generated environment, or a mix of both. Use the techniques from the lessons or your own methods. Document your process, explain your choices, and create a visually impressive graphic or animation.

# Skills Module 3 - DATA MINING THE CITY

## OUTLINE
In this module, we’ll learn how to collect and analyze data from cities. We’ll start with public data sources like the London Datastore and learn how to visualize different types of data. We’ll also explore web APIs (like TfL, Flickr, and Google Maps) to pull data automatically. For websites without APIs, we’ll learn how to scrape data using a web browser. We’ll use sentiment analysis and machine learning to analyze text and images. Most of the work will be done in Python, Rhino, and Illustrator.

## LEARNING CONTENT
- Data scraping techniques in Python, including how to use APIs and decode JSON responses.
- Using Python libraries to work with Flickr and Google Maps.
- Sentiment analysis and mapping techniques in Python.

## ASSIGNMENT
Choose a data source like Flickr or Google. Pick an area that’s different from your main project site and create maps to visualize the data. Show how your code works, make different data requests, and display the results (like type, year, comments, etc.). Make sure your dataset is large and doesn’t overlap with your teammates’ work.
