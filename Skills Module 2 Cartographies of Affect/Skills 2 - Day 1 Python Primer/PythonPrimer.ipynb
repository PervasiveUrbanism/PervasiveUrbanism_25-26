    "## What is Python?\n",
    "Python is a high-level programming language created by Guido van Rossum in the late 1980s. It is designed to be readable, concise, and easy to learn — qualities that have made it popular in data science, web development, automation, and scripting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python can be embedded or scripted inside many applications and environments such as Blender, QGIS, Raspberry Pi, and Rhino. In this course we focus on using CPython and Jupyter notebooks for teaching and hands-on exercises.\n",
    "\n",

    "## Installation\n",
    "Choose a Python 3.x release (Python 2.7 is obsolete) and an environment to work in. Below are common options and quick guidance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common environments\n",
    "- The simple Python IDE that ships with the language (good for quick experiments).\n",
    "- *Jupyter Notebooks* or JupyterLab (interactive documents used in this course).\n",
    "- Browser-based services such as *Google Colab* (no local install required).\n",
    "- Full editors/IDEs like *Visual Studio Code* or *PyCharm*. Visual Studio Code is widely used and has great Python support: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/python-tutorial\n",
    "\n",
    "Choosing between these environments can be confusing — and there’s really no single right or wrong answer.\n",
    "First and foremost, it’s important to note that Jupyter Notebooks allow you to mix text and code in one document — perfect for a learning environment like this one.\n",
    "Since a Jupyter Notebook is simply a file format (.ipynb), it can run in many different contexts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Personally, I’ve settled on VS Code and Google Colab.\n",
    "VS Code is extremely popular, and its AI-assisted code completion is remarkably powerful.\n",
    "If you’re running code locally, it’s a great choice — though it requires installing Python and a few extensions first. Most of the time, setup is straightforward… sometimes less so.\n",
    "\n",
    "That’s where Google Colab shines: you just start coding — no installation, no dependencies, everything comes preconfigured. It’s free and online.\n",
    "The downside? No internet means no code — everything runs in the cloud.\n",
    "Also, with the free version, your session may disconnect after some time (for example, if you leave a process running overnight). That’s normal — Google encourages upgrading to a paid plan, which is quite affordable given the service.\n",
    "\n",
    "And yes, there are other options such as PyCharm or Conda environments — but I don’t have much experience with them, so I can’t comment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### AI support\n",
    "\n",
    "AI-assisted coding is incredibly powerful.\n",
    "Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT or GitHub Copilot are easy to use and can dramatically improve productivity.\n",
    "Over the years, coding has become faster and more accessible thanks to these tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "You’re encouraged to use them — they can help you write, debug, and optimize your code.\n",
    "However, remember that AI can assist you, but it cannot replace understanding.\n",
    "You still need to know how to ask the right questions and read the code that’s suggested.\n",
    "That’s why learning the language itself remains essential.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Windows\n",
    "1. Download the latest Python 3 installer from https://python.org.\n",
    "2. Run the installer and check **Add Python to PATH** before continuing. The default options work for most users.\n",
    "\n",
    "### macOS\n",
    "Download the macOS installer on python.org and follow the installer steps. On macOS you typically won't be prompted for PATH changes; the installer configures the system correctly.\n",

    "Output:\n",
    "\n",
    "In five years, I’ll be 40.\n",

    "### Escape Characters and Raw Strings\n",
    "\n",
    "Escape characters are special sequences in a string that represent actions or symbols that are difficult to type directly.\n",
    "They always start with a backslash (\\), which tells Python that the following character has a special meaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "- \\n → newline (moves text to the next line)\n",
    "- \\t → tab (inserts a horizontal tab)\n",
    "- \\\\ → backslash (adds a literal backslash)\n",
    "- \\\" → double quote (lets you include quotes inside a string)\n",
    "\n",
    "These are interpreted inside normal strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(\"Hello\\nWorld\")\n",
    "\n",
    "Output:\n",
    "\n",
    "Hello\n",
    "World\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to prevent Python from interpreting backslashes as escape characters, you can prefix the string with r to make it a raw string.\n",
    "In a raw string, backslashes are treated as literal characters—useful, for instance, when writing Windows file paths.\n",

    "\n",
    "Python isn’t just a single program — it’s a **language specification** that can be implemented in different ways.\n",
    "Each implementation targets a particular ecosystem or performance goal, and they differ slightly in speed, compatibility, and integration with external libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "### CPython (Reference Implementation)\n",
    "\n",
    "* What it is: The *default* and *official* implementation of Python, written in C.\n",
    "* Why it matters: Most tutorials, libraries, and frameworks (like NumPy, Pandas, and TensorFlow) are designed for CPython.\n",
    "* When to use: Almost always — this is the version you get when you download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org).\n",
    "* Key strength: Broadest compatibility with third-party modules, especially those written in C or C++.\n",
    "\n",
    ">  Note for Rhino users: \n",
    ">\n",
    "> * Rhino 7 officially supports IronPython (based on .NET).\n",
    "> * Rhino 8 introduces CPython integration , which allows direct use of modern Python libraries and tools (including NumPy, Matplotlib, and requests).\n",
    ">  This change makes Rhino 8 much more flexible and compatible with the wider Python ecosystem.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "###  IronPython (.NET Integration)\n",
    "\n",
    "* What it is: A Python implementation built on Microsoft’s .NET Framework .\n",
    "* Why it matters: It lets Python code interact seamlessly with C#, F#, and other .NET languages.\n",
    "* When to use: Ideal when working inside .NET-based environments or integrating with Windows applications and tools like Rhino 7 or Unity (C#) .\n",
    "* Limitations: C-extension libraries (e.g., NumPy, SciPy) are not supported because IronPython does not interface directly with CPython’s C API.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Jython (Java Virtual Machine)\n",
    "\n",
    "* What it is: A Python implementation written in Java that runs on the JVM (Java Virtual Machine).\n",
    "* Why it matters: It enables Python scripts to import and use Java classes natively.\n",
    "* When to use: Perfect for integrating Python into existing Java projects or enterprise tools running on the JVM.\n",
    "* Limitations: Like IronPython, it lacks support for native C-extension modules.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "###  MicroPython and CircuitPython \n",
    "\n",
    "* What they are: Lightweight implementations of Python designed for microcontrollers and embedded systems .\n",
    "* Why they matter: They let you write hardware-level logic (e.g., sensors, LEDs, motors) in a clean, Pythonic syntax.\n",
    "* When to use: Great for physical computing , IoT , or Arduino-like experiments.\n",
    "* Difference: \n",
    "  * MicroPython is minimal and efficient.\n",
    "  * CircuitPython (by Adafruit) adds simplified syntax and built-in hardware libraries for beginners and educators.\n"
