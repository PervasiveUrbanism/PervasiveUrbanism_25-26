Food was below expectations. The beef tartare was good, but small and buried under some random salad and copious black pepper on the side. The \"peppers and cod roe\" was cumbersome to eat since the stems were left on the peppers but incorporated into the dish (and also hidden under some salad). The cod roe or peppers separately would be good, but wasn't a good combination. I am not sure why the chicken rice was purposely burned to the bottom of the pan and also burned on top. The burning didn't add anything to the dish and made the rice a teeth breaker if not careful. The confit shallot and chicken leg didn't seem confit - they were a bit tough and hard to eat, especially with them both being burnt. The liver in the dish was quite good, but couldn't make up for the somewhat dry rice. It came with a separate dish of salad which I was encouraged to mix with the chicken rice since \"it is so rich\". If they had ever been to South East Asia, they would have tasted an amazing chicken rice. The chef, Miguel, was very kind and tried to make it better. But since I am leaving London soon and since I wasn't so interested in eating more of this food, I was reluctant. Adding to my disappointment, this place has been recommended by friends for a while. But thanks again to the kind staff who tried hard to accommodate me. Update: They included an allergen in my salad after I told them about it. My allergens aren't fatal, but I'd be careful if you eat here and have allergies.", "time": 1732884893, "translated": false}]}, "status": "OK"}
