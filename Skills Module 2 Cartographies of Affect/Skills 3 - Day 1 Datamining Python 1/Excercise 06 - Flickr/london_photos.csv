Another London shot from the archives.  I'm not sure why this dawn shot of London Bridge, a Thomas Heatherwick designed Routemaster double decker bus and St Pauls Cathedral wasn't uploaded sooner.  I don't often find myself in central London at dawn but this was a rare sunrise from the 2022 Photo24 event.

The closed station was the terminus of a short spur of the Piccadilly Line from Holborn, originally called 'Strand' when it opened in 1907. Little used it started restricting services as early as 1917 and finally closed for good in 1994 by which time the line was only operating as a rush hour shuttle. London Transport decided that the cost of replacing the ageing lifts couldn't be justified by the small footfall. 

However, the station has been preserved below ground, including the platform and track plus a working tube train and is regularly used as a filming location. Pre booked guided tours can also be arranged.

Le corps de la femme nue, déformé par la gêne, alors qu'elle s'essuie après un bain, semble pris au dépourvu dans un moment d'intimité. Ces scènes intimes ont de plus en plus occupé Edgar Degas dans les dernières décennies de sa carrière. Comme c'est typique de ses pastels, le médium est appliqué en couches distinctes, avec peu de mélange, sur un dessin au fusain sous-jacent. Cette méthode, propre à Degas, crée de merveilleuses dérives de couleurs et des rythmes linéaires inhabituels, brouillant la frontière entre dessin et peinture.

Charcoal and pastel on two sheets of tracing paper, Edgar Degas (1834-1917).
Her body awkwardly contorted in the act of towelling herself after a bath, the naked woman in this vibrant pastel seems to be caught unawares in a private moment. Such intimate scenes increasingly occupied Edgar Degas in the later decades of his career. As is typical of his pastels, the medium is applied in distinct layers, with little blending, over a charcoal underdrawing. This method, unique to Degas, creates marvellous drifts of colour and unusual linear rhythms, blurring the boundary between drawing and painting.",2024-06-29 15:29:54,51.511500,-0.117974,https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53902672377_c2f8d8324e_m.jpg,philippeguillot21,130828646@N02,photo

Georges Seurat a peint cette vue de la Seine en utilisant une technique qu'il avait récemment développée, appelée « pointillisme ». Elle consistait à placer des points de couleur côte à côte pour créer une image au lieu de mélanger les couleurs sur une palette. Les nouvelles théories optiques de l'époque suggéraient que cela rendait la surface du tableau plus vibrante. Cependant, l'effet global est celui de la mélancolie et de la tranquillité, accentué par les arbres verticaux et les mâts des bateaux. La cheminée d'usine à l'arrière-plan rappelle que la ville de Courbevoie devenait rapidement une banlieue industrielle de Paris.

Oil paint on canvas by Georges Seurat (1859-1891).
Georges Seurat painted this view of the river Seine using a technique he had recently developed, called 'pointillism'. It entailed placing coloured dots side by side to create an image, instead of mixing colours on a palette. New optical theories at the time suggested that this made teh surface of the painting ùore vibrant. However, the overall effect is one of melancholy and stilness, emphasised by the vertical trees and masts of boats. The factory chimney in the background is a reminder that the reiverside town of Courbevoie was rapidly becoming an industrial suburb of Paris.

La montagne Sainte-Victoire, avec son sommet déchiqueté, domine la campagne autour d'Aix-en-Provence, la ville natale de Paul Cézanne, dans le sud de la France. Pour lui, elle incarnait le paysage accidenté et les habitants de la Provence. Cézanne a peint la montagne depuis différents points de vue tout au long de sa carrière. Ce tableau est le plus monumental. Des zones vertes et jaunes attirent le regard vers l'imposante Sainte-Victoire, peinte dans des tons bleus et roses froids. Les branches de pin balayantes au premier plan suivent les contours de la montagne. C'était l'un des dispositifs de cadrage préférés de Cézanne et on le retrouve également dans le &quot;Lac d'Annecy&quot;, suspendu à proximité. La qualité intemporelle du décor n'est interrompue que par le viaduc ferroviaire moderne sur la droite et la traînée de ruisseau laissée par un train qui passe.

Oil paint on canvas by Paul Cézanne (1839-1906).
The mountain Sainte-Victoire, with its jagged top; dominates the countryside around Paul Cézanne's homtown of Aix-en-Provence in southern France. For him, it embodied the rugged landscape and people of Provence.  Cézanne painted the mountain from different vantage points throughout his career. This painting is the most monumental. Areas of green and yellow jead the eye to the towering Sainte-Victoire, painted in cool blues and pinks. The sweeping pine branches in the foreground follow the contours of the mountain. This was one of the Cézanne's favourite framing devices and it also found in 'Lac d'Annecy', hanging bearby. The timeless quality of the setting is interruped only by the modern railway viaduct on the right and the trail of stream left by a passing train.",2024-06-29 14:29:53,51.511500,-0.117974,https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53901234261_f79aa3a173_m.jpg,philippeguillot21,130828646@N02,photo

Cette œuvre a été réalisée en préparation de l'un des tableaux les plus célèbres du XIXe siècle. En 1863, Édouard Manet a scandalisé le monde de l'art avec sa version achevée et de grande taille de cette composition. Elle était choquante car elle représentait en taille réelle deux femmes presque nues aux côtés d'hommes entièrement habillés en vêtements contemporains. Bien que Manet se soit d'abord inspiré des nus de la Renaissance, il a rejeté le voile de la mythologie et peint des figures féminines non idéalisées, dont l'une confronte le spectateur avec son regard direct.

This work was made in preparation for one of the most famous paintings of the 19th century. In 1863, Edouard Manet scandalised the art world with his large, finished version of this composition.

From Wikipedia, &quot;The Strand (commonly referred to with a leading &quot;The&quot;, but formally without) is a major street in the City of Westminster, Central London. The street, which is part of London's West End theatreland, runs just over 3⁄4 mile (1.2 km) from Trafalgar Square eastwards to Temple Bar, where it becomes Fleet Street in the City of London, and is part of the A4, a main road running west from inner London.

The road's name comes from the Old English strond, meaning the beach or edge of a river, as it historically ran alongside the north bank of the River Thames. The river side of the street was home to grand houses, interspersed with slum alleys, between the 12th and 17th centuries. Historically important mansions built between the Strand and the river included Essex House, Arundel House, Old Somerset House, Savoy Palace, Durham House, York House and Cecil House, none of which survive. The aristocracy moved to the West End during the 17th century, and the Strand became known for its coffee shops, restaurants and taverns. The street was a centre point for theatre and music hall during the 19th century, and several venues have survived to the current day.&quot;

From Wikipedia, &quot;Somerset House is a large Renaissance complex situated on the south side of the Strand in central London, overlooking the River Thames, just east of Waterloo Bridge. The Georgian era quadrangle was built on the site of a Tudor palace (&quot;Old Somerset House&quot;) originally belonging to the Duke of Somerset in 1547. The present Somerset House was designed by Sir William Chambers, begun in 1776, and was further extended with Victorian era outer wings to the east and west in 1831 and 1856 respectively. The site of Somerset House stood directly on the River Thames until the Victoria Embankment parkway was built in the late 1860s.

The great Georgian era structure was built to be a grand public building housing various government and public-benefit society offices. Its present tenants are a mixture of various organisations, generally centred around the arts and education.&quot;

From Wikipedia, &quot;The Strand (commonly referred to with a leading &quot;The&quot;, but formally without) is a major street in the City of Westminster, Central London. The street, which is part of London's West End theatreland, runs just over 3⁄4 mile (1.2 km) from Trafalgar Square eastwards to Temple Bar, where it becomes Fleet Street in the City of London, and is part of the A4, a main road running west from inner London.

The road's name comes from the Old English strond, meaning the beach or edge of a river, as it historically ran alongside the north bank of the River Thames. The river side of the street was home to grand houses, interspersed with slum alleys, between the 12th and 17th centuries. Historically important mansions built between the Strand and the river included Essex House, Arundel House, Old Somerset House, Savoy Palace, Durham House, York House and Cecil House, none of which survive. The aristocracy moved to the West End during the 17th century, and the Strand became known for its coffee shops, restaurants and taverns. The street was a centre point for theatre and music hall during the 19th century, and several venues have survived to the current day.&quot;

From Wikipedia, &quot;Somerset House is a large Renaissance complex situated on the south side of the Strand in central London, overlooking the River Thames, just east of Waterloo Bridge. The Georgian era quadrangle was built on the site of a Tudor palace (&quot;Old Somerset House&quot;) originally belonging to the Duke of Somerset in 1547. The present Somerset House was designed by Sir William Chambers, begun in 1776, and was further extended with Victorian era outer wings to the east and west in 1831 and 1856 respectively. The site of Somerset House stood directly on the River Thames until the Victoria Embankment parkway was built in the late 1860s.

The great Georgian era structure was built to be a grand public building housing various government and public-benefit society offices. Its present tenants are a mixture of various organisations, generally centred around the arts and education.&quot;

The present five storey stair is a replica of what was there up until the original suffered significant damage in The Blitz during World War II. It was rebuilt in the early 1950s using the original plans 

The architecturally interesting stair, which is located in the South Wing, was originally built in the late 18th century to the designs of Sir William Chambers with each flight a different configuration to the one underneath (the design was apparently made to reflect something of the stairs on ships).

It was initially known as the Navy Stair but renamed the Nelson Stair, ostensibly in honour of Vice-Admiral Horatio Nelson.",2024-07-05 13:43:21,51.510597,-0.117600,https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53847847725_b806866166_m.jpg,Andy J Newman,126771727@N04,photo

From Wikipedia, &quot;Waterloo Bridge is a road and foot traffic bridge crossing the River Thames in London, between Blackfriars Bridge and Hungerford Bridge and Golden Jubilee Bridges. Its name commemorates the victory of the British, Dutch and Prussians at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815. Thanks to its location at a strategic bend in the river, the bridge offers good views of Westminster, the South Bank and the London Eye to the west, and of the City of London and Canary Wharf to the east.&quot;

She was renamed HMS President in 1922 and moored permanently on the Thames as a Royal Navy Reserve drill ship. In 1982 she was sold to private owners and, having changed hands twice, served as a venue for conferences and functions as well as the offices for a number of media companies. She has been moved to Chatham on the Medway in Kent since 2016, but is due to return to the capital. She had the suffix &quot;(1918)&quot; added to her name in order to distinguish her from HMS President, the Royal Naval Reserve base in St Katharine Docks. She is one of the last three surviving Royal Navy warships of the First World War.[Note 1] She is also the sole representative of the first type of purpose built anti-submarine vessels, and is the ancestor of World War II convoy escort sloops, which evolved into modern anti-submarine frigates.",2010-09-21 09:35:29,51.510672,-0.112073,https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53841031557_73cd27bcdf_m.jpg,Anthony Tomlin,81866840@N06,photo

From Wikipedia, &quot;Southwark is a district of Central London situated on the south bank of the River Thames, forming the north-western part of the wider modern London Borough of Southwark. The district, which is the oldest part of South London, developed due to its position at the southern end of the early versions of London Bridge, for centuries the only dry crossing on the river. Around 43 AD, engineers of the Roman Empire found the geographic features of the south bank here suitable for the placement and construction of the first bridge.

London's historic core, the City of London, lay north of the bridge and for centuries the area of Southwark just south of the bridge was partially governed by the City, while other areas of the district were more loosely governed. The section known as Liberty of the Clink became a place of entertainment. By the 12th century Southwark had been incorporated as an ancient borough, and this historic status is reflected in the alternative name of the area, as Borough. The ancient borough of Southwark's river frontage extended from the modern borough boundary, just to the west of the Oxo Tower, to St Saviour's Dock (originally the mouth of the River Neckinger) in the east. In the 16th century, parts of Southwark near London Bridge became a formal City ward, Bridge Without.&quot;

In spite of exhorting people to travel on the Underground and Overground as an alternative to dozens of highly disrupted bus routes, TfL allowed planned engineering works to go ahead on significant sections of both.

This one is at the east end, the other at the west.

They’re known as Sunrise and Sunset; this one (Sunrise) features a Swiss landscape. Both were designed by Clayton and Bell, one of the most prolific stained glass workshops in Victorian England, noted for their use of brilliant, luminous colours. Their work is to be seen in countless religious buildings throughout the world. And here.

Two Temple Place is a neo-Gothic mansion that was built for William Waldorf Astor in the 1890s. At the time, he was the richest man in the world, and he spared no expense when work began on the property in 1892.

At the time, Astor was the richest man in the world, and he spared no expense when work began on Two Temple Place in 1892. In addition to its exquisite wood-panelled rooms, it also hosts what was once the largest strongroom in Europe. More about the interior will follow.

Meanwhile, a bit about William Waldorf Astor. He was born in New York in 1848, and thanks to shipping, fur trading and property investment, was a member of one of the richest dynasties in US history, inheriting a vast fortune in 1890. But he disliked America (and America disliked him) so he emigrated to Britain in 1890.

His extreme wealth enabled him to purchase Cliveden, the 17th century country house in Buckinghamshire, plus Hever Castle, Anne Boleyn’s family home in Kent. He also bought a number of newspapers, most notably <i>The Observer</i> in 1911, which remained in the family for more than 70 years. Astor also made considerable philanthropic gifts in the UK, which may or may not have helped him become a British citizen in 1899, and a Peer of the Realm in 1916. He died in 1919.

The tower is flanked by 2-storey domed lobbies with segmental headed doorways, heavy porch projecting from tower base; Gibbs surrounds to bell stage openings, the steeple rising in 3 diminishing octagonal stages. Squat lower register windows to sides with tall semicircular arched windows in architraves above, lighting galleries.

Exceptional treatment of island site, the design directly reflecting Gibbs' first hand experience of Rome as well as references to Wren at St Paul's. 7-bay sides, 3-bay west front and apsidal east end. Superimposed orders, Corinthian over Ionic, the latter developed into bowed porch (with finialled semi-dome) to west front, above which the centre bay has pairs of columns and pediment, the tower and steeple rising above in 3 diminishing stages. The sides have alternate segmental and triangular pedimented niches. 

As an island church the ground floor was designed without windows to keep the noise out. The extravagant Baroque ornamentation of the exterior was criticised at the time, and matters were not helped when one of the urns surmounting the exterior of the church fell off and killed a passer-by during a procession in 1802.

Designed by Leslie Green. Steel frame clad in brick, faced in ox-blood red faience produced by the Leeds Fireclay Co Ltd. The surface building occupies the irregular footprint of the Royal Strand Theatre that previously stood on the site. 

Leslie Green (1875-1908) was appointed Architect to the UERL in 1903 and designed 40 stations for the company in a distinctive Edwardian Baroque house style clad in ox-blood faience. They followed a standardised design and plan adapted to the site. Interiors comprised a ground-floor ticket hall with lifts, a spiral stair down to lower corridors, and further stairs down to the platforms which were usually parallel. The upper storey housed lift machinery and office space. Most ticket halls featured deep-green tiling with a stylised acanthus-leaf or pomegranate frieze, and ticket windows with curved pediments. Aldwych was built when finances had reached rock bottom, so as a cost cutting exercise they had a timber version of the windows; this is the only one to survive.  The station closed in 1994 due to the cost of renewing lift machinery, and since then has been used for filming and events.",2024-03-05 18:11:05,51.511032,-0.119411,https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53715216606_405a2955c1_m.jpg,TheCameraMuseum.,52141631@N08,photo

Portland stone ashlar and red bricks laid in English bond with granite, marble and red sandstone dressings. The building has four and five storeys and is arranged as two principal blocks grouped around a quadrangular courtyard to the east. The lengthy southern front facing the Strand (shown) is divided into several distinct parts and repeated motifs help to tie the design together into a unified whole: a screen of arches with wrought iron panels stands in front of the façade; tourelles with candle-snuffer roofs, circled by a blind arcade of miniature arches, appear at the corners and at either side of the two portals leading to the central hall. The entrance to the central hall is gradually stepped back from the street line. At the centre of this grouping is a large, recessed portal with a carved arch, flanked by granite columns. Above is a miniature open arcade. The southern gable end of the central hall is placed behind and has a five-light window in a richly-carved surround and a rose window to the gable. The apex carries a sculpture of Christ the Law Giver and to the ridge beyond is a flèche.

In the early C19 the London Law Courts were grouped alongside the Palace of Westminster. The architect John Soane had designed a new series of superior courts for common law and equity in 1820 which were connected to the west flank of Westminster Hall and used parts of its abundant space as partitioned courtrooms and also as a gathering place. As the C19 progressed, and the rise of Britain as an industrial and trading nation created more litigation and these courts became unsuitable.  A Parliamentary Select Committee was set up in 1841 and commissioned a design from Sir Charles Barry for a new court house.  Eventually this was not followed through but was influential in its plan.  The building by G. E. Street is acknowledged as one of the foremost examples of High Victorian Gothic Revival design.

53697896583,65535,3e030c0626,"Bomber [""Butcher""] Harris statue celebrates what exactly?",,1331,"Butcher Harris Statue to celebrate what exactly?

There have been frequent and understandable demands that the statue should be taken down. 

Arthur Harris was head of Bomber Command for much of the Second World War during which he was responsible for the carpet bombing of German cities, including overseeing the devastating incendiary firestorm raids on Hamburg and  Dresden.

To his credit, Harris did criticize Churchill's government for its dishonesty in maintaining that RAF bombing was focusing on precision bombing of German strategic and industrial targets.  He urged the government to be more open about what the RAF was doing, declaring that 

“The aim of the Combined Bomber Offensive should be unambiguously stated [as] the destruction of German cities, the killing of German workers, and the disruption of civilised life throughout Germany ... the destruction of houses, public utilities, transport and lives, the creation of a refugee problem on an unprecedented scale”.  These were &quot;intended aims of our bombing policy. They are not by-products of attempts to hit factories.&quot; 

<a href=""https://www.ppu.org.uk/news/pressure-grows-over-bomber-harris-statue"" rel=""noreferrer nofollow"">www.ppu.org.uk/news/pressure-grows-over-bomber-harris-statue</a>

<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combined_Bomber_Offensive"" rel=""noreferrer nofollow"">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combined_Bomber_Offensive</a>

Previously he played a key role in the bombing of civilian towns and villages in Iraq and Afghanistan (on what was then India's North West Frontier.) 

Summing up RAF operations against towns and villages in Mesopotamia (Iraq), sometimes given the go ahead for the non-payment of collective punishment fines, Arthur Harris wrote in memo for MPs - 

&quot;‘Whereas a year ago, we largely relied on noisy inaccuracy and moral effect… they (the Arabs and Kurds) now know that within 45 minutes a full size village… can be practically wiped out and a third of its inhabitants killed or injured by four or five machines.’

During a bombing operation in northern Iraq in 1924, when the RAF official target was a &quot;well defined area in the centre of the town (of Sulaymaniyah),&quot; Harris cheerfully reported that his aircraft had dropped three canisters of incendiary bombs ‘from one end of Sulaimaniya (sic) to the other.’  This time the raid was authorised as a warning to the local governor to desist from raising local &quot;illegal&quot; taxes.  An official RAF damage report estimated the number of houses destroyed at between 50 and 100 and boasted that a large portion of the town’s ancient souk had been completely gutted.

Portland stone ashlar and red bricks laid in English bond with granite, marble and red sandstone dressings. The building has four and five storeys and is arranged as two principal blocks grouped around a quadrangular courtyard to the east. The lengthy southern front facing the Strand (shown) is divided into several distinct parts and repeated motifs help to tie the design together into a unified whole: a screen of arches with wrought iron panels stands in front of the façade; tourelles with candle-snuffer roofs, circled by a blind arcade of miniature arches, appear at the corners and at either side of the two portals leading to the central hall. The entrance to the central hall is gradually stepped back from the street line. At the centre of this grouping is a large, recessed portal with a carved arch, flanked by granite columns. Above is a miniature open arcade. The southern gable end of the central hall is placed behind and has a five-light window in a richly-carved surround and a rose window to the gable. The apex carries a sculpture of Christ the Law Giver and to the ridge beyond is a flèche.

In the early C19 the London Law Courts were grouped alongside the Palace of Westminster. The architect John Soane had designed a new series of superior courts for common law and equity in 1820 which were connected to the west flank of Westminster Hall and used parts of its abundant space as partitioned courtrooms and also as a gathering place. As the C19 progressed, and the rise of Britain as an industrial and trading nation created more litigation and these courts became unsuitable.  A Parliamentary Select Committee was set up in 1841 and commissioned a design from Sir Charles Barry for a new court house.  Eventually this was not followed through but was influential in its plan.  The building by G. E. Street is acknowledged as one of the foremost examples of High Victorian Gothic Revival design.

53697896583,65535,3e030c0626,"Bomber [""Butcher""] Harris statue celebrates what exactly?",,1331,"Butcher Harris Statue to celebrate what exactly?

There have been frequent and understandable demands that the statue should be taken down. 

Arthur Harris was head of Bomber Command for much of the Second World War during which he was responsible for the carpet bombing of German cities, including overseeing the devastating incendiary firestorm raids on Hamburg and  Dresden.

To his credit, Harris did criticize Churchill's government for its dishonesty in maintaining that RAF bombing was focusing on precision bombing of German strategic and industrial targets.  He urged the government to be more open about what the RAF was doing, declaring that 

“The aim of the Combined Bomber Offensive should be unambiguously stated [as] the destruction of German cities, the killing of German workers, and the disruption of civilised life throughout Germany ... the destruction of houses, public utilities, transport and lives, the creation of a refugee problem on an unprecedented scale”.  These were &quot;intended aims of our bombing policy. They are not by-products of attempts to hit factories.&quot; 

<a href=""https://www.ppu.org.uk/news/pressure-grows-over-bomber-harris-statue"" rel=""noreferrer nofollow"">www.ppu.org.uk/news/pressure-grows-over-bomber-harris-statue</a>

<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combined_Bomber_Offensive"" rel=""noreferrer nofollow"">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combined_Bomber_Offensive</a>

Previously he played a key role in the bombing of civilian towns and villages in Iraq and Afghanistan (on what was then India's North West Frontier.) 

Summing up RAF operations against towns and villages in Mesopotamia (Iraq), sometimes given the go ahead for the non-payment of collective punishment fines, Arthur Harris wrote in memo for MPs - 

&quot;‘Whereas a year ago, we largely relied on noisy inaccuracy and moral effect… they (the Arabs and Kurds) now know that within 45 minutes a full size village… can be practically wiped out and a third of its inhabitants killed or injured by four or five machines.’

During a bombing operation in northern Iraq in 1924, when the RAF official target was a &quot;well defined area in the centre of the town (of Sulaymaniyah),&quot; Harris cheerfully reported that his aircraft had dropped three canisters of incendiary bombs ‘from one end of Sulaimaniya (sic) to the other.’  This time the raid was authorised as a warning to the local governor to desist from raising local &quot;illegal&quot; taxes.  An official RAF damage report estimated the number of houses destroyed at between 50 and 100 and boasted that a large portion of the town’s ancient souk had been completely gutted.

53648677453,65535,e0a6784fa9,In solidarity with Julian Assange outside Australia House,,2588,"On Wednesday 10 April 2024, a protest was held by Julian Assange supporters outside Australia House in central London.  Julian Assange has Australian citizenship and there is some hope that the Australian government might feel pressured to exert diplomatic pressure on his behalf.

The rally was held one day prior to the fifth anniversary of Julian Assange's arrest by British police at the Ecuadorian embassy in London and Assange's subsequent incarceration, often in prolonged solitary confinement, within the high security Belmarsh Prison in South East London, awaiting extradition proceedings to the United States, where he faces a prison sentence of up to 175 years for the crime of reporting the truth about US government crimes, particularly war crimes during its so called war on terror.

Taken at night in the courtyard which also is home to the famous Edmond J. Safra fountains which have featured in movies. A London landmark with neoclassical architecture, Somerset House has been used as a location in many major film and TV shoots including Suffragette, The Duchess, Love Actually and Mary Poppins Returns.  

From Wikipedia:
&quot;Somerset House is a popular filming location, with its exterior featuring in several big-budget Hollywood films. These include two James Bond films, GoldenEye (1995) and Tomorrow Never Dies (1997), and several scenes of the 2003 film Shanghai Knights, starring Jackie Chan and Owen Wilson, were filmed in the courtyard of Somerset House. The courtyard was also used in the 1991 comedy King Ralph. Elements of the 2008 film The Duchess, starring Keira Knightley and Ralph Fiennes, were filmed in October 2007. Somerset House was also used as a filming location in several Sherlock Holmes films, including 1970's The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes and, more recently, Sherlock Holmes (2009), starring Jude Law and Robert Downey Jr., directed by Guy Ritchie. Somerset House was used as the external filming location for Olivia Newton-John's Stranger's Touch video, which featured as part of her Olivia Physical video album in 1981.

Exterior shots of Somerset House were used in the 1999 Tim Burton horror film Sleepy Hollow, starring Johnny Depp, and the 2006 film Flyboys. Somerset House was a filming location in the 2012 Bollywood film Jab Tak Hai Jaan, which starred Shah Rukh Khan, Katrina Kaif and Anushka Sharma, directed by Yash Chopra. Somerset House Courtyard was also used in the 2008 movie Last Chance Harvey, with Dustin Hoffman and Emma Thompson. Scenes were filmed in Somerset House for the Olympus Has Fallen sequel, London Has Fallen (2016). Exterior shots of Somerset House stood in for Himmler's HQ in Berlin in the 1976 film The Eagle Has Landed. The tunnels under Somerset House have also been used in filming Harry Potter, specifically some of scenes depicting 'Diagon Alley'.&quot;",2024-02-18 21:08:11,51.511466,-0.117226,https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53562870189_cf5ae070cb_m.jpg,flindersan,71896983@N07,photo

Following on from the recent official #Flickrturns20 photowalk in the morning the London Flickr group reconvened for a short afternoon post-photowalk photowalk.  Our route took us through the centre of the London School of Economics and I grabbed this candid shot as we went.

For anyone interested, the next London Flickr photowalk will be this coming Saturday, March 2nd.  More details here if you'd like to come along : <a href=""https://www.flickr.com/groups/londonflickrgroup/discuss/72157721920256541/"">www.flickr.com/groups/londonflickrgroup/discuss/721577219...</a>

From Wikipedia, &quot;The London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE) is a public research university in London, England, and a member institution of the University of London. Founded in 1895 by Fabian Society members Sidney Webb, Beatrice Webb, Graham Wallas and George Bernard Shaw, LSE joined the University of London in 1900 and established its first degree courses under the auspices of the university in 1901. LSE began awarding its degrees in its own name in 2008, prior to which it awarded degrees of the University of London. It became a university in its own right within the University of London in 2022.

LSE is located in the London Borough of Camden and Westminster, Central London, near the boundary between Covent Garden and Holborn. The area is historically known as Clare Market. LSE has more than 11,000 students, just under seventy percent of whom come from outside the UK, and 3,300 staff. The university has the sixth-largest endowment of any university in the UK and in 2022/23, it had an income of £466.1 million of which £39.6 million was from research grants. Despite its name, the school is organised into 25 academic departments and institutes which conduct teaching and research across a range of pure and applied social sciences.&quot;

Designed by C I Phipps and decorated by Collinson &amp; Locke, the most beautifully fitted theatre in Europe opened its doors with a transfer from the Opera Comique of Gilbert and Sullivan’s opera Patience.

Built at the instigation of Impresario Richard D’Oyly Carte, who wanted his own theatre in order to stage the works of Gilbert and Sullivan, the Savoy Theatre became famous as the first public building in the world to be lit by incandescent electric lights.

On 3rd June 1929, the Victorian auditorium was invaded by workmen and demolished and, 135 days later “a gleaming palace had sprung up”, a magic miracle of modernism built by Rupert D’Oyly Carte with Frank Tugwell as the architect and decorative designs by Basil Ionides. The Theatre re-opened on 21st October 1929 with a revival of Gilbert and Sullivan’s The Gondoliers, designed by Charles Ricketts and conducted by Dr Malcolm Sargent.

The original church of St Mary le Strand was demolished in 1549 to make way for Somerset House.  In 1711, the parishioners successfully petitioned the Commissioners that a church should be reinstated in the Strand and work begun in 1714.  The new church was consecrated on 1st January 1724.

The church is a fine and beautiful example of baroque design by James Gibbs, an architect of high technical competence and originality, informed by a sophisticated knowledge of ancient, Renaissance and contemporary European architecture.

St Mary’s is the London church of the WRNS (the Women’s Royal Naval Service).&quot;

But this time I was passing from the other direction after trying to get a good shot of Two Temple Place and noticed this composition. 

The Temple station was opened in the parish of St. Clement Danes on 30 May 1870 by the District Railway (DR; now the District line) when the company extended its line from Westminster to St. Paul's station (now called Blackfriars). The construction of the new section of the DR was planned in conjunction with the building of the Victoria Embankment and was achieved by the cut and cover method of roofing over a shallow trench.

The DR connected to the Metropolitan Railway (MR; now the Metropolitan line) at South Kensington and, although the two companies were rivals, each company operated its trains over the other's tracks in a joint service known as the &quot;Inner Circle&quot;.

So, Flickr turned 20 at the weekend...... In addition to the official photowalk arranged by Flickr HQ, the London Flickr Group organised a 'unofficial' extension for the afternoon.  This is the motley bunch that made it all the way to the end, with the exception of 'Hello Kitty' who insisted on posing with us.....

Our next walk will be on Saturday, March 2nd.  More details here if you'd like to come along : <a href=""https://www.flickr.com/groups/londonflickrgroup/discuss/72157721920256541/"">www.flickr.com/groups/londonflickrgroup/discuss/721577219...</a>

53569274521,65535,f343203cb0,24-038  Ex-Metropolitan Railway Metropolitan-Vickers Electric Loco No. 5 'John Hampden',,1242,"Taken 28/02/24; Uploading the previous snaps of No. 23 I find it hard to visualise regular steam worked services on the UndergrounD.  I also struggle with the notion that, in my lifetime (well just about),  loco hauled services were a feature on the Metropolitan Line.  However, up until the the Amersham electrification in 1961, the 20 locos built by Metropolitan-Vickers in 1922-3  worked services as far as Rickmansworth, where  a steam loco took over.

Two of the class survive; No.  5 ‘John Hampden’ seen here in the London Transport Museum at Covent Garden and No. 12 ‘Sarah Siddons’, which has been preserved in operational condition.  No. 5 owes its survival to becoming the Acton Works shunter after its passenger duties ended.  On final withdrwal it was restored for the London Transport Collection at Syon Park in Brentford in 1973. It has been on display here at London Transport Museum since 1980, when the Covent Garden site opened.

Finally who was John Hampden?   Over to Wikipedia, Hampden  (1595 – 1643) &quot;... was an English landowner and politician whose opposition to 'arbitrary' taxes imposed by Charles I made him a national figure. Allied with Parliamentarian leader John Pym, and cousin to Oliver Cromwell, he was among the Five Members whose attempted arrest in January 1642 helped to spark the First English Civil War.&quot;",2024-02-28 00:00:00,51.512429,-0.121462,https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53569274521_f343203cb0_m.jpg,Clive G',50576141@N03,photo

Taken at night in the courtyard which also is home to the famous Edmond J. Safra fountains which have featured in movies. A London landmark with neoclassical architecture, Somerset House has been used as a location in many major film and TV shoots including Suffragette, The Duchess, Love Actually and Mary Poppins Returns.  

From Wikipedia:
&quot;Somerset House is a popular filming location, with its exterior featuring in several big-budget Hollywood films. These include two James Bond films, GoldenEye (1995) and Tomorrow Never Dies (1997), and several scenes of the 2003 film Shanghai Knights, starring Jackie Chan and Owen Wilson, were filmed in the courtyard of Somerset House. The courtyard was also used in the 1991 comedy King Ralph. Elements of the 2008 film The Duchess, starring Keira Knightley and Ralph Fiennes, were filmed in October 2007. Somerset House was also used as a filming location in several Sherlock Holmes films, including 1970's The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes and, more recently, Sherlock Holmes (2009), starring Jude Law and Robert Downey Jr., directed by Guy Ritchie. Somerset House was used as the external filming location for Olivia Newton-John's Stranger's Touch video, which featured as part of her Olivia Physical video album in 1981.

Exterior shots of Somerset House were used in the 1999 Tim Burton horror film Sleepy Hollow, starring Johnny Depp, and the 2006 film Flyboys. Somerset House was a filming location in the 2012 Bollywood film Jab Tak Hai Jaan, which starred Shah Rukh Khan, Katrina Kaif and Anushka Sharma, directed by Yash Chopra. Somerset House Courtyard was also used in the 2008 movie Last Chance Harvey, with Dustin Hoffman and Emma Thompson. Scenes were filmed in Somerset House for the Olympus Has Fallen sequel, London Has Fallen (2016). Exterior shots of Somerset House stood in for Himmler's HQ in Berlin in the 1976 film The Eagle Has Landed. The tunnels under Somerset House have also been used in filming Harry Potter, specifically some of scenes depicting 'Diagon Alley'.&quot;",2024-02-18 21:08:11,51.511466,-0.117226,https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53562870189_cf5ae070cb_m.jpg,flindersan,71896983@N07,photo

Following on from the recent official #Flickrturns20 photowalk in the morning the London Flickr group reconvened for a short afternoon post-photowalk photowalk.  Our route took us through the centre of the London School of Economics and I grabbed this candid shot as we went.

For anyone interested, the next London Flickr photowalk will be this coming Saturday, March 2nd.  More details here if you'd like to come along : <a href=""https://www.flickr.com/groups/londonflickrgroup/discuss/72157721920256541/"">www.flickr.com/groups/londonflickrgroup/discuss/721577219...</a>

From Wikipedia, &quot;The London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE) is a public research university in London, England, and a member institution of the University of London. Founded in 1895 by Fabian Society members Sidney Webb, Beatrice Webb, Graham Wallas and George Bernard Shaw, LSE joined the University of London in 1900 and established its first degree courses under the auspices of the university in 1901. LSE began awarding its degrees in its own name in 2008, prior to which it awarded degrees of the University of London. It became a university in its own right within the University of London in 2022.

LSE is located in the London Borough of Camden and Westminster, Central London, near the boundary between Covent Garden and Holborn. The area is historically known as Clare Market. LSE has more than 11,000 students, just under seventy percent of whom come from outside the UK, and 3,300 staff. The university has the sixth-largest endowment of any university in the UK and in 2022/23, it had an income of £466.1 million of which £39.6 million was from research grants. Despite its name, the school is organised into 25 academic departments and institutes which conduct teaching and research across a range of pure and applied social sciences.&quot;

Once part of a scheme of windows designed by Whall but made by the studio of W.G. Sanders and thus lacking much of Whall's usual finish and far more Victorian in conception.

Astor emigrated to England from America in 1891 as the richest man in the world, and he spared no expense when work began on Two Temple Place in 1892, so the building now provides us with a vivid narrative of his life and the endeavour of the remarkable craftspeople who shaped it. It was designed by one of the foremost neo-Gothic architects of the late nineteenth-century, John Loughborough Pearson, and in addition to the fantastical and opulent interior, Two Temple Place originally contained the largest strongroom in Europe as well as two other enormous fortified safes.  It served as an impregnable bolthole for the reclusive and eccentric Astor, a central London pied-à-terre with his private apartment and bedroom upstairs.

An 8mm fisheye shot of the Nelson Stair at Somerset House, as photographed during the recent London Flickr Group photowalk.  Having spent about ten minutes taking photos, the group were then told by a security guard that we weren't allowed to take photos with 'professional' cameras......

For anyone interested, the next London Flickr photowalk will be on Saturday, March 2nd.  More details here if you'd like to come along : <a href=""https://www.flickr.com/groups/londonflickrgroup/discuss/72157721920256541/"">www.flickr.com/groups/londonflickrgroup/discuss/721577219...</a>

From Wikipedia : &quot;Somerset House had its share of trials and tribulations during World War II. Apart from comparatively minor blast effects at various times, sixteen rooms and the handsome rotunda staircase (the Nelson Stair) were completely destroyed in the South Wing, and a further 27 damaged in the West Wing by a direct hit in October 1940. Still more windows were shattered and balustrades toppled, but the worst was over by the end of May 1941.

It was not until the 1950s that this damage to the South Wing was repaired. The work required skilled masons, whose services were hard to come by in the early post-war years. Sir Albert Richardson was appointed architect for the reconstruction. He skillfully recreated the Nelson Room and rebuilt the Nelson Stair. The work was completed in 1952 at a cost of (then) £84,000. The newly restored part of the South Wing was taken by the Inland Revenue's Solicitor's Office and &quot;Establishments&quot; (now commonly &quot;HR&quot;) Division, augmenting their existing accommodation in the West Wing.

In 1984 the Somerset House Act was passed, legislating the way for Somerset House to be redeveloped as a centre for the arts. In 1997 the Somerset House Trust was established as a charity to maintain the building and develop it as a centre for arts and culture.&quot;

Designed by C I Phipps and decorated by Collinson &amp; Locke, the most beautifully fitted theatre in Europe opened its doors with a transfer from the Opera Comique of Gilbert and Sullivan’s opera Patience.

Built at the instigation of Impresario Richard D’Oyly Carte, who wanted his own theatre in order to stage the works of Gilbert and Sullivan, the Savoy Theatre became famous as the first public building in the world to be lit by incandescent electric lights.

On 3rd June 1929, the Victorian auditorium was invaded by workmen and demolished and, 135 days later “a gleaming palace had sprung up”, a magic miracle of modernism built by Rupert D’Oyly Carte with Frank Tugwell as the architect and decorative designs by Basil Ionides. The Theatre re-opened on 21st October 1929 with a revival of Gilbert and Sullivan’s The Gondoliers, designed by Charles Ricketts and conducted by Dr Malcolm Sargent.

The station has been used as a filming location in conjunction with the London Transport Museum who also organise occasional tours. It was also used to store art works during the blitz in WW2.

The original church of St Mary le Strand was demolished in 1549 to make way for Somerset House.  In 1711, the parishioners successfully petitioned the Commissioners that a church should be reinstated in the Strand and work begun in 1714.  The new church was consecrated on 1st January 1724.

The church is a fine and beautiful example of baroque design by James Gibbs, an architect of high technical competence and originality, informed by a sophisticated knowledge of ancient, Renaissance and contemporary European architecture.

St Mary’s is the London church of the WRNS (the Women’s Royal Naval Service).&quot;

The High Court also sits on circuit and in other major cities. Designed by George Edmund Street, who died before it was completed, it is a large grey stone edifice in the Victorian Gothic Revival style built in the 1870s and opened by Queen Victoria in 1882. It is one of the largest courts in Europe. It is a Grade I listed building.

It is located on Strand within the City of Westminster, near the boundary with the City of London (Temple Bar). It is surrounded by the four Inns of Court, St Clement Danes church, The Australian High Commission, King's College London and the London School of Economics. The nearest London Underground stations are Chancery Lane and Temple. The Central Criminal Court, widely known as the Old Bailey after its street, is about 1⁄2 mile (0.8 km) to the east—a Crown Court centre with no direct connection with the Royal Courts of Justice.

History

For centuries these courts were located in Westminster Hall; however, in the 19th century, justices decided the courts needed a purpose-built structure. Much of the preparatory legal work was completed by Edwin Wilkins Field including promotion of the Courts of Justice Building Act 1865 and the Courts of Justice Concentration (Site) Act 1865. A statue of Field stands in the building. Parliament paid £1,453,000 for the 6-acre (24,000 m2) site upon which 450 houses had to be demolished.

The search for a design for the Law Courts was by way of a competition, a then-common approach to selecting a design and an architect. The competition ran from 1866 to 1867 and the twelve architects competing for the contract each submitted designs for the site. In 1868 it was finally decided that George Edmund Street was the winner. Building was started in 1873 by Messrs Bull &amp; Sons of Southampton. Its masons led a serious strike at an early stage which threatened to extend to the other trades and caused a temporary stoppage of the works. In consequence, foreign workmen were brought in – mostly Germans. This aroused bitter hostility on the part of the men on strike, and the newcomers had to be housed and fed within the building. However, these disputes were eventually settled and the building took eight years to complete; it was officially opened by Queen Victoria on 4 December 1882.

Street died before the building was opened, overcome by the work. The building was paid for by cash accumulated in court from the estates of the intestate to the sum of £700,000. Oak work and fittings in the court cost a further £70,000 and with decoration and furnishing the total cost for the building came to under £1 million.

The building was extended to the designs of Sir Henry Tanner to create the West Green building completed in 1912. The Queen's Building followed in 1968 and the Thomas More Courts were completed in January 1990.

The building was used as a &quot;Nightingale Court&quot; for criminal trials during the Covid-19 pandemic in 2021.

Architecture

The design involves a symmetrical main frontage of facing The Strand; the central section, which is stepped back, features an arched doorway leading to the Great Hall; it has a five-part window in a carved surround on the first floor and a gable containing a rose window above. At the top of the gable is a sculpture of Jesus with a flèche behind. There are also statues of Moses, Solomon and Alfred the Great, the four statues symbolising the pillars of English legal tradition. There are towers containing lancet windows on either side of the central section with side wings beyond. At the eastern end of the Strand frontage is a tall clock tower topped by a pyramidal roof, finial and flagpole; it contains a clock and five bells (weighing a total of 8¼ tons) by Gillett, Bland &amp; Co..

Internally, courts are arranged off the Great Hall which runs north–south; there is a courtyard to the east with offices for courtroom staff arranged round the courtyard. The Great Hall contains a bust of Queen Victoria by the sculptor, Alfred Gilbert.

Architectural historian Nikolaus Pevsner has described the building as &quot;an object lesson in free composition, with none of the symmetry of the classics, yet not undisciplined where symmetry is abandoned&quot;. David Brownlee has claimed that it was influenced by the reformist political movement and the High Victorian architectural movement and has described it as a &quot;regular mongrel affair&quot;] while Turnor described it as the &quot;last great secular building of the Gothic Revival&quot;.

The Government Art Collection contains a painting by Henry Tanworth Wells depicting Queen Victoria opening the building in 1882.

Die Royal Courts of Justice (RCJ) (Königliche Gerichtshöfe), allgemein Law Courts (Rechtshöfe) genannt, sind ein Gebäude in London, das den Court of Appeal (Berufungsgericht) und den High Court of Justice (Zivilgericht) von England und Wales beherbergt.

Der Quaderbau aus grauem Stein wurde 1874–1882 in der Spätphase des Gothic Revival errichtet. Architekt war George Edmund Street. Die Royal Courts befinden sich an der Strand, an der Grenze zwischen der City of London und der City of Westminster. Die Gerichtssäle sind öffentlich zugänglich, wobei bei bestimmten Gerichtsfällen Einschränkungen erlassen werden können. Zentrum des Komplexes ist eine gewaltige rippengewölbte Halle von 80 m Länge mit einem Mosaikboden nach einem Entwurf von Street. In der Nähe des Gebäudes befinden sich auch die vier Inns of Court.

Der Court of Appeal und der High Court waren bis 2009 zusammen der Supreme Court, also Oberster Gerichtshof, von England und Wales, unterschieden sich in ihrer Funktion aber erheblich vom Supreme Court der USA. Sie behandelten zwar weitaus mehr Gerichtsfälle, besaßen aber auf Verfassungsstufe einen viel geringeren Einfluss.

Die nächstgelegenen Stationen der London Underground sind Temple und Chancery Lane.

The High Court also sits on circuit and in other major cities. Designed by George Edmund Street, who died before it was completed, it is a large grey stone edifice in the Victorian Gothic Revival style built in the 1870s and opened by Queen Victoria in 1882. It is one of the largest courts in Europe. It is a Grade I listed building.

It is located on Strand within the City of Westminster, near the boundary with the City of London (Temple Bar). It is surrounded by the four Inns of Court, St Clement Danes church, The Australian High Commission, King's College London and the London School of Economics. The nearest London Underground stations are Chancery Lane and Temple. The Central Criminal Court, widely known as the Old Bailey after its street, is about 1⁄2 mile (0.8 km) to the east—a Crown Court centre with no direct connection with the Royal Courts of Justice.

History

For centuries these courts were located in Westminster Hall; however, in the 19th century, justices decided the courts needed a purpose-built structure. Much of the preparatory legal work was completed by Edwin Wilkins Field including promotion of the Courts of Justice Building Act 1865 and the Courts of Justice Concentration (Site) Act 1865. A statue of Field stands in the building. Parliament paid £1,453,000 for the 6-acre (24,000 m2) site upon which 450 houses had to be demolished.

The search for a design for the Law Courts was by way of a competition, a then-common approach to selecting a design and an architect. The competition ran from 1866 to 1867 and the twelve architects competing for the contract each submitted designs for the site. In 1868 it was finally decided that George Edmund Street was the winner. Building was started in 1873 by Messrs Bull &amp; Sons of Southampton. Its masons led a serious strike at an early stage which threatened to extend to the other trades and caused a temporary stoppage of the works. In consequence, foreign workmen were brought in – mostly Germans. This aroused bitter hostility on the part of the men on strike, and the newcomers had to be housed and fed within the building. However, these disputes were eventually settled and the building took eight years to complete; it was officially opened by Queen Victoria on 4 December 1882.

Street died before the building was opened, overcome by the work. The building was paid for by cash accumulated in court from the estates of the intestate to the sum of £700,000. Oak work and fittings in the court cost a further £70,000 and with decoration and furnishing the total cost for the building came to under £1 million.

The building was extended to the designs of Sir Henry Tanner to create the West Green building completed in 1912. The Queen's Building followed in 1968 and the Thomas More Courts were completed in January 1990.

The building was used as a &quot;Nightingale Court&quot; for criminal trials during the Covid-19 pandemic in 2021.

Architecture

The design involves a symmetrical main frontage of facing The Strand; the central section, which is stepped back, features an arched doorway leading to the Great Hall; it has a five-part window in a carved surround on the first floor and a gable containing a rose window above. At the top of the gable is a sculpture of Jesus with a flèche behind. There are also statues of Moses, Solomon and Alfred the Great, the four statues symbolising the pillars of English legal tradition. There are towers containing lancet windows on either side of the central section with side wings beyond. At the eastern end of the Strand frontage is a tall clock tower topped by a pyramidal roof, finial and flagpole; it contains a clock and five bells (weighing a total of 8¼ tons) by Gillett, Bland &amp; Co..

Internally, courts are arranged off the Great Hall which runs north–south; there is a courtyard to the east with offices for courtroom staff arranged round the courtyard. The Great Hall contains a bust of Queen Victoria by the sculptor, Alfred Gilbert.

Architectural historian Nikolaus Pevsner has described the building as &quot;an object lesson in free composition, with none of the symmetry of the classics, yet not undisciplined where symmetry is abandoned&quot;. David Brownlee has claimed that it was influenced by the reformist political movement and the High Victorian architectural movement and has described it as a &quot;regular mongrel affair&quot;] while Turnor described it as the &quot;last great secular building of the Gothic Revival&quot;.

The Government Art Collection contains a painting by Henry Tanworth Wells depicting Queen Victoria opening the building in 1882.

(Wikipedia)

Die Royal Courts of Justice (RCJ) (Königliche Gerichtshöfe), allgemein Law Courts (Rechtshöfe) genannt, sind ein Gebäude in London, das den Court of Appeal (Berufungsgericht) und den High Court of Justice (Zivilgericht) von England und Wales beherbergt.

Der Quaderbau aus grauem Stein wurde 1874–1882 in der Spätphase des Gothic Revival errichtet. Architekt war George Edmund Street. Die Royal Courts befinden sich an der Strand, an der Grenze zwischen der City of London und der City of Westminster. Die Gerichtssäle sind öffentlich zugänglich, wobei bei bestimmten Gerichtsfällen Einschränkungen erlassen werden können. Zentrum des Komplexes ist eine gewaltige rippengewölbte Halle von 80 m Länge mit einem Mosaikboden nach einem Entwurf von Street. In der Nähe des Gebäudes befinden sich auch die vier Inns of Court.

Der Court of Appeal und der High Court waren bis 2009 zusammen der Supreme Court, also Oberster Gerichtshof, von England und Wales, unterschieden sich in ihrer Funktion aber erheblich vom Supreme Court der USA. Sie behandelten zwar weitaus mehr Gerichtsfälle, besaßen aber auf Verfassungsstufe einen viel geringeren Einfluss.

Die nächstgelegenen Stationen der London Underground sind Temple und Chancery Lane.

53335023819,65535,ee30e48a63,The heroism of Palestinian resistance,,7270,"On Saturday 29 October 2023, at least 100,000 and possibly as many as 300,000 people demonstrated in London in solidarity with Palestinians. It was not just a reaction to the devastating bombing of Gaza and the blockade of energy, fuel, electricity, food and water from 2.3 million Palestinians living in the city and the surrounding strip.

في يوم السبت 29 أكتوبر/تشرين الأول 2023، تظاهر ما لا يقل عن 100 ألف وربما يصل إلى 300 ألف شخص في لندن تضامنًا مع الفلسطينيين. ولم يكن ذلك مجرد رد فعل على القصف المدمر على غزة والحصار شبه الكامل للطاقة والوقود والكهرباء والغذاء والماء عن 2.3 مليون فلسطيني يعيشون في المدينة والمنطقة المحيطة بها.

It was also a determination to see an end to -

كما دعا المتظاهرون إلى إنهاء جميع العوامل الرئيسية التي تغذي الصراع.

1) An end to Palestinian suffering from 75 years of Israeli occupation. The Israeli occupation of the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip since 1967 is officially recognised by the United Nations and most of the world despite the fact that the occupation is often ignored or sometimes even denied by Western media.  As Amnesty International reports Israeli occupation has resulted in &quot;systematic human rights violations against Palestinians living there.&quot; 

نهاية معاناة الفلسطينيين من 75 عاما من الاحتلال الإسرائيلي. إن الاحتلال الإسرائيلي للضفة الغربية والقدس الشرقية وقطاع غزة منذ عام 1967 معترف به رسميًا من قبل الأمم المتحدة ومعظم دول العالم على الرغم من أن وسائل الإعلام الغربية غالبًا ما يتم تجاهل الاحتلال أو حتى إنكاره في بعض الأحيان. وكما أفادت منظمة العفو الدولية، فإن الاحتلال الإسرائيلي قد أدى إلى &quot;انتهاكات منهجية لحقوق الإنسان ضد الفلسطينيين الذين يعيشون هناك&quot;.

2) An end to Palestinians living under a highly restrictive Apartheid regime as recognised by Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and War on Want. Across the West Bank Palestinians are banned from driving on numerous roads that cross the region and as War on Want explains &quot;Jewish Israelis and Palestinians are treated differently in almost every aspect of life: housing, education, health, employment, family life, residence and freedom of movement. Dozens of Israeli laws and policies institutionalise this prevailing system of racial discrimination and domination.&quot; 

وضع حد للفلسطينيين الذين يعيشون في ظل نظام فصل عنصري شديد التقييد كما اعترفت به منظمة العفو الدولية وهيومن رايتس ووتش ومنظمة الحرب على العوز. في جميع أنحاء الضفة الغربية، يُمنع الفلسطينيون من القيادة على العديد من الطرق التي تعبر المنطقة، وكما توضح مؤسسة &quot;الحرب على العوز&quot; الخيرية، &quot;يتم التعامل مع اليهود الإسرائيليين والفلسطينيين بشكل مختلف في كل جانب من جوانب الحياة تقريبًا: السكن والتعليم والصحة والتوظيف والأسرة&quot;. الحياة والإقامة وحرية التنقل.. عشرات القوانين والسياسات الإسرائيلية تضفي الطابع المؤسسي على هذا النظام السائد من التمييز العنصري والسيطرة.

3) An end to restrictions on movement.  Across the West Bank there are some 650 Israeli military checkpoints through which only some Palestinians are allowed to pass, often with humiliating questioning and delays, so that they can travel to other towns whether to visit families, seeking medical treatment or for any other reason. In Gaza, travel is even more difficult and only a tiny minority with work permits have been allowed to cross the border - the rest have to remain in what is often described as the world's largest open air prison - the densely populated Gaza strip housing some 2.3 million people.  

إنهاء القيود المفروضة على الحركة. يوجد في جميع أنحاء الضفة الغربية حوالي 650 نقطة تفتيش عسكرية إسرائيلية لا يُسمح إلا لبعض الفلسطينيين بالمرور من خلالها، مع استجواب وتأخير مهين، حتى يتمكنوا من السفر إلى مدن أخرى سواء لزيارة عائلاتهم أو طلب العلاج الطبي أو لأي سبب آخر. وفي غزة، يعد السفر أكثر صعوبة ولم يُسمح إلا لأقلية صغيرة من حاملي تصاريح العمل بعبور الحدود - أما الباقون فيجب أن يبقوا في ما يوصف في كثير من الأحيان بأنه أكبر سجن مفتوح في العالم - وهو قطاع غزة المكتظ بالسكان والذي يضم حوالي 2.3 نسمة. مليون شخص.

4) An end to the 16 years of siege imposed by Israel on Gaza which means that around 56% of children were suffering from anemia and only 4% had access to safe drinking water even before the outbreak of conflict this month.  

إنهاء الحصار الذي تفرضه إسرائيل على غزة منذ 16 عاماً. ويعني الحصار أن حوالي 56% من الأطفال كانوا يعانون من فقر الدم وأن 4% فقط كانوا يحصلون على مياه الشرب الآمنة حتى قبل اندلاع النزاع هذا الشهر.

5) The never ending process of Israeli expansion across Palestinian land, including the demolition of 55,000 Palestinian homes since 1967, occurring on a near monthly basis as well as the cutting down of fields of olive trees and the ploughing up of Palestinian farms to make room for yet more illegal settlements subsidised by the Israeli government.

These settlements are illegal under international law, which rightly recognises the 1967 border. However, since 1967, Israel has constructed 250 of them across the West Bank in which over 633,000 Israelis live in subsidised and often luxurious housing with swimming pools and manicured lawns, an unimaginable privilege to the vast majority of Palestinians. 

وضع حد للتوسع الإسرائيلي الذي لا ينتهي عبر الأراضي الفلسطينية، بما في ذلك هدم 55.000 منزل فلسطيني منذ عام 1967، والذي يحدث على أساس شهري تقريبًا، فضلاً عن قطع حقول أشجار الزيتون وحراثة المزارع الفلسطينية. وترتكب هذه الجرائم ضد الفلسطينيين لإفساح المجال أمام إقامة المستوطنات الإسرائيلية غير القانونية التي تدعمها الحكومة الإسرائيلية

ومن الواضح أن المستوطنات غير قانونية بموجب القانون الدولي، الذي يعترف بحق بحدود عام 1967. ومع ذلك، منذ عام 1967، شيدت إسرائيل 250 منها في جميع أنحاء الضفة الغربية، حيث يعيش أكثر من 633 ألف إسرائيلي في مساكن مدعومة وفاخرة في كثير من الأحيان مع حمامات سباحة ومروج مشذبة، وهو امتياز لا يمكن تصوره لجميع الفلسطينيين تقريبًا.

6) Never ending acts of settler terrorism against Palestinians.  Western media rightly condemns occasional Palestinian attacks on Israeli civilians, including the appalling atrocities committed by Hamas on 7 October.  However, for years illegal Israeli settlers in the West Bank have staged attacks against Palestinians, sometimes motivated sheerly by hatred, but often by the desire to inflict terror and to ethnically cleanse an area.  The most recent incident was an attack on Wednesday 11 October in which masked settlers killed three Palestinian villagers and then killed a Palestinian father and son attending the funeral the next day. 

وضع حد لأعمال الإرهاب التي يمارسها المستوطنون ضد الفلسطينيين. وتدين وسائل الإعلام الغربية عن حق الهجمات الفلسطينية العرضية على المدنيين الإسرائيليين، بما في ذلك الفظائع المروعة التي ارتكبتها حماس في 7 تشرين الأول/أكتوبر. ومع ذلك، ظل المستوطنون الإسرائيليون غير الشرعيين في الضفة الغربية لسنوات يشنون هجمات ضد الفلسطينيين، بدافع الكراهية في بعض الأحيان، ولكن في كثير من الأحيان بسبب التصميم على ترويع الفلسطينيين وتطهيرهم عرقيًا من منطقة ما. وكانت آخر الحوادث هي الهجوم الذي وقع يوم الأربعاء 11 تشرين الأول/أكتوبر، حيث قتل مستوطنون ملثمون ثلاثة قرويين فلسطينيين ثم قتلوا أبًا فلسطينيًا وابنه كانا يحضران الجنازة في اليوم التالي.

7) The division of Palestinian land by the separation wall.  The 708 km Separation Wall, completed in 2005, was supposedly built to protect Israel from any Palestinians that might be able to enter the country without permission, but 85% of it runs up to 18 km inside the internationally recognised 1967 boundary (&quot;Green Line&quot;), frequently dividing Palestinians villagers from their farmland as well as running through the middle of farms and dividing arable land from key water supplies.  

Some 10% of the West Bank now lies between the wall and the 1967 border, an area into which everyone, except Palestinians, is allowed entry. Not surprisingly, the International Court of Justice has issued an advisory opinion that the separation wall is a contravention of international law and in 2003 the UN General Assembly passed a resolution demanding its removal by 144 votes to just 4.  Analysts also fear that the wall acts as a de facto annexation of all the Palestinian land that lies to the west of it.

<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_West_Bank_barrier"" rel=""noreferrer nofollow"">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_West_Bank_barrier</a>

8) The myth of Palestinian rejectionism. Western mainstream media usually maintains falsely that it is Palestinians that have constantly rejected a two-state solution, whereas the opposite is the case.  Arab states and the Palestinians have frequently made clear their willingness to negotiate a future two-state solution on the basis of the 1967 frontiers, while Israel is committed to preventing any such solution and continuing its territorial expansion.  

As early as 1976, Egypt, Syria and Jordan presented a two-state solution resolution to the UN Security Council based on the 1967 Green Line (in accordance with the international consensus) but it was vetoed outright by the United States, even though Washington at the time publicly acknowledged the illegality of all Israeli settlements across the Palestinian West Bank.  The same happened again in 1980.   

Later in 1988, the PLO put forward their position in a declaration by the Palestinian National Council calling for a Palestinian state alongside Israel with guarantees of security to both countries.  However in May 1989, Israel's Likud-Labour coalition government made it crystal clear that they would not accept an &quot;additional&quot; Palestinian state between Jordan and Israel, regardless of what Jordanians, Palestinians or the rest of the world might think.  The founding charter of Benjamin Netanyahu's Likud Party still &quot;flatly rejects the establishment of a Palestinian state west of the Jordan river.&quot;  

<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Likud"" rel=""noreferrer nofollow"">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Likud</a>

9) The frequent killing by Israeli security forces of peaceful protesters, women, children, journalists and medics, including the assassination of renowned Al Jazeera correspondent Shireen Abu Akleh in May last year.  In the nine months of 2023 prior to 7 October,  248 Palestinians, 40 of them children, had been killed by Israeli soldiers, but these deaths attracted almost no attention in the Western media.  Palestinian lives have always been very cheap.  

<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMIZTiN-TrE"" rel=""noreferrer nofollow"">www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMIZTiN-TrE</a>

10) The current refusal of Israel to allow any journalists into the Gaza Strip so they can see and report on, obviously at their own risk, the destruction and casualties and suffering of the civilian population.

11) An end to &quot;administrative detentions&quot; across the West  Bank under which thousands of Palestinians have been detained without any right to be told under what charges they are being held, let alone any right to a free trial. As the Israeli human rights organisation B'Tselem explains 

&quot;Administrative detention is incarceration without trial or charge, alleging that a person plans to commit a future offense. It has no time limit, and the evidence on which it is based is not disclosed. Israel employs this measure extensively and routinely, and has used it to hold thousands of Palestinians for lengthy periods of time. While detention orders are formally reviewed, this is merely a semblance of judicial oversight, as detainees cannot reasonably mount a defense against undisclosed allegations. Nevertheless, courts uphold the vast majority of orders.&quot;  

<a href=""https://www.btselem.org/topic/administrative_detention"" rel=""noreferrer nofollow"">www.btselem.org/topic/administrative_detention</a>

12) An end to Israeli soldiers controlling access to and frequently preventing Muslims from visiting the Al Aqsa Mosque in Israeli occupied East Jerusalem [Al Quds],  considered the third holiest site in Islam after Mecca and Medina.  On several occasions, Israeli troops and/or police have also attacked worshippers using batons, stun grenades and tear gas, igniting understandable anger across the Islamic World.  Radical Israeli settlers also sometimes enter under the protection of Israeli security forces and some also perform Jewish rituals in contravention of current agreements about non-Muslims being allowed in, but only as visitors.

53274025101,65535,c2a9b996f3,"'A lot of your problems will soon be taken over by machines'—Shell advert from Service Station magazine, December 1975",shell shellmex petrol petrolpump averyhardoll averyhardollmkiv servicestation,1438,"If only the headline had been true! (Likewise &quot;Your future is sure with Shell&quot;... <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milieudefensie_v_Royal_Dutch_Shell"" rel=""noreferrer nofollow"">the opposite seems true, if anything</a>)

An intriguing advertisement aimed at garage owners, from <em>Service Station</em> magazine. The Avery-Hardoll Mk IV pump illustrated on the left, mentioned as being in operation at Solent Self-Service in Gosport is also seen in <a href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/danlockton/51813795065"">this clipping</a>. This Avery-Hardoll model marks a point where petrol pumps started to be sold more of parts of a fully connected system, with data logging, electronic displays updatable from the kiosk, and even data transmission via modem and phone line. The low, angled unit with an eye-level display was quite different in form to more traditional petrol pumps. .    

Some of the &quot;pole&quot;-style pumps, with the actual pump equipment remote from the unit itself, were experimented with by the major brands, including BP and National, and indeed I believe that one of the models was manufactured by one of Alan Pond's companies, but this approach didn't seem to last in the longer-term; likewise with the canopy-mounted &quot;spacefill&quot; type systems, although more widely seen outside the UK.

One interesting detail is seeing the old-fashioned-sounding Shellmex on the fascia of the left-hand &quot;vacuum cleaner&quot;-style pump; I don't know when Shell officially dropped the Shellmex / Shell-Mex name for its lowest, 2-star grade. On more old-fashioned Shell sites it continued to be seen right up to the introduction of unleaded. For example, Moore Brothers in Crediton, Devon, still had its 2-star pump labelled as Shellmex as late as 1988 (see below).

Paul Hamlyn Hall at left is a large iron and glass structure adjacent to, and with direct access to, the main opera house building. The hall now acts as the atrium and main public area of the opera house. The redevelopment for that purpose in the 1990s involved lifting up the cast iron structure to accommodate new public areas for the opera house underneath. 

Hamlyn Hall was formerly known as Floral Hall, as it was originally built by the Opera House to house a flower and vegetable market. It was designed by Barry and opened in 1860. After being used as a concert hall, it became part of the Covent Garden Market in 1887. A fire broke out in the building in 1956, after which it sat derelict. It was acquired by the Opera House in 1977 and used as storage space until the 1990s.",2023-04-20 21:44:14,51.512977,-0.121637,https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53225057203_7d589c1420_m.jpg,Anita363,61897811@N00,photo

The circumstances of his detention were described in 2019 as amounting to mental torture by Nils Melzer, the UN Rapporteur on Torture, who pointed out that Assange was being 'detained under oppressive conditions of isolation and surveillance, not justified by his detention status,' and that his life was at risk. Melzer also commented that Assange showed 'all the symptoms typical for prolonged exposure to psychological torture.'

About 40 cyclists as well as a number of other activists without cycles gathered outside Belmarsh Prison for the start of a mass cycle ride protest from the prison via the Cutty Sark and the Tower of London to the Royal Courts of Justice on the Strand in central London.

Once they reached the Royal Courts of Justice, they joined others already waiting on the pavement outside for a second rally and listened to the UK's former ambassador to Uzbekistan and now prominent human rights activist, Craig Murray, give a speech in which he declared that protests would continue until Assange was free.   Activists held up banners calling for his freedom, hung up yellow ribbons for him and distributed leaflets to, as well as talking with, passers by.

They were demonstrating against the continued imprisonment of Julian Assange and the US extradition proceedings, for revealing the truth about US, UK and other Western war crimes, the mass surveillance of their populations and other crimes.  

Meanwhile, the war crimes themselves go largely ignored and the political leaders responsible for them are not only immunized against prosecution, but several are growing wealthy on the basis of their contacts with their overseas accomplices across the Middle East and elsewhere.   

There are currently protests in London most weeks in solidarity with Assange outside Belmarsh prison usually around lunchtime on Saturdays, at Piccadilly Circus usually on Saturdays between 4 pm and 6 pm and at  Australia House usually on Wednesdays between 3 and 5 pm. 

There are many good reasons why Assange should be released, but arguably the three most important are as follows -  

Freedom of Speech: Assange's case raises important concerns about freedom of the press and whistleblowers' rights, which are crucial for a transparent society.

Health Concerns: Julian Assange's physical and mental health deteriorated in prison. Releasing him could provide access to better medical care and reduce the risk of serious health issues.

Human Rights: His prolonged detention without trial or conviction goes against fundamental human rights principles.

Standing at the eastern end of The Strand, the church until recently was one of only two - Island Churches - along with St. Clemments Danes. Recently rhe one side has been pedestrianised. The Church was designed by architect James Gibbs being his first major project following his return from Italy, on a site that had formerly a great maypole, which had been the scene of May Day festivities in the 16th and 17th century but had since decayed. The Church was the first of  twelve new churches (known as Queen Anne Churches) built under The Commission to Build Fifty Churches and was built at a total cost of £ 16,000. Construction began in February 1714  with the steeple completed in 1717, although the Church was not consecrated for use until 1 January 1724, and was restored in 1871 by Robert Jewell Withers.

According to Gibbs, the church was originally intended to be an Italianate structure with a small campanile over the west end and no steeple, with a 250 foot column surmounted with a statue of Queen Anne errected a short distance to its West. The stone for the column was purchased but following Queene Annes death in 1714 that plan was abandonded. Instead, the architect was ordered to reuse the stone to build a steeple.

The exterior of the Church had extravagent Baroque ornamentation while its interior is richly decorated with a plastered ceiling in white and gold.

It is the official church of the Women's Royal Naval Service, and has a book of remembrance for members who have died in service. 

In 1809 John Dickens and Elizabeth Barrow, the parents of Charles Dickens, were married here. It is also alleged that in 1750 while on a secrect visit to London, the young pretender, Bonnie Prince Charllie renounced his Roman Cathlic faith faith in the church to become an Anglican

53163817335,65535,eccdb9e61d,Gloria Wildman says 'If Assange ain't free then neither are we!',,3168,"On Saturday 2 September, Assange solidarity activists worldwide held an Australian Embassy Day appealing to the Australian government to intervene in the politically driven case against Julian Assange.  In London they gathered outside Australia House on the Strand.   Among them was Gloria Wildman, 79, who was carrying a sign declaring

'If Assange ain't free then neither are we!!!' 

[ I hope to post a few more photos from last weekend later this week. ]

They were also demonstrating against the continued imprisonment of Julian Assange and the US extradition proceedings, for revealing the truth about US, UK and other Western war crimes, the mass surveillance of their populations and other crimes.  

Meanwhile, the war crimes themselves go largely ignored and the political leaders responsible for them are not only immunized against prosecution, but several are growing wealthy on the basis of their contacts with their overseas accomplices across the Middle East and elsewhere.   

Apart from last Saturday's protest, there are also weekly protests in solidarity with Assange outside Australia House in London every Wednesday between 3 and 5 pm. 

There are many good reasons why Assange should be released, but arguably the three most important are as follows -  

Freedom of Speech: Assange's case raises important concerns about freedom of the press and whistleblowers' rights, which are crucial for a transparent society.

Health Concerns: Julian Assange's physical and mental health deteriorated in prison. Releasing him could provide access to better medical care and reduce the risk of serious health issues.

Human Rights: His prolonged detention without trial or conviction goes against fundamental human rights principles.

Seen at the London Transport Museum in Covent Garden is RM1737 (737DYE). The Routemaster is synonymous with London and would be fair to say was the ultimate in rear entrance double-deckers. Indeed it’s a bus design that has become the defacto image for a double-decker bus, even though production stopped in the late 1960s and most buses have been rear-engined since then. It’s also outlived it’s three replacements, namely the DMS-class Daimler/Leyland Fleetline and the Leyland Titan/MCW Metrobus. In the end, it was accessibility requirements that saw the last Routemasters be retired from front-line service in 2005. 

This one has been restored to 1970s/earlier 1980s condition featuring a LT-roundel and just before the break-up of London Transport’s bus fleet into separate operating units under the new term of London’s Buses. This was to prepare for route-tendering in London - London was spared full blown deregulation - as it was felt smaller units would be more efficient for bidding for tenders.",2023-03-23 17:09:08,51.512169,-0.121317,https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52767284462_c1c50d5a19_m.jpg,Exiled Bhoy no longer in Fife,89656176@N08,photo
52768309553,65535,151b804131,London Transport AEC RT-Tyoe/Park Royal Vehicles,,1585,"Every inch the classic

Before the Routemaster, there was the RT-type or Regent Type. Based on the very successful AEC Regent III, it was the standard London Bus. London Transport ordered 338 (later reduced to 150) chassis, which were in production when World War II broke out in September 1939. However, with the Fall of France in June 1940, delivery slowed progressively. The last of the batch, RT 151, did not reach London Transport until January 1942, six months after its predecessor, although all were built to full pre-war specification. These vehicles were lighter in weight than their postwar counterparts.

The only other RT-type chassis constructed before the end of the war was destined for and went to Glasgow Corporation. Details of it are: AEC Regent IIIRT/Weymann H30/26R body (Fleet No. 723, Registration No. DGB371) It was originally intended to be an exhibit at the 1939 Commercial Motor Show, but this was cancelled, due to the outbreak of war. It differed from the pre-war London examples in having a body built by Weymann, the front blind area being very much in the Cowieson-body style, Glasgow Corporation's usual body builder at the time, although the cab area/radiator was very similar to the London vehicles. It was delivered in February 1940 and sold out of service, to a dealer, in 1956.

Production of the RT recommenced in late 1946, being delayed by London Transport's desire to have the bodies jig-built, following its experience building Halifax bombers at Aldenham Tube Depot (later to become its main bus works). The new vehicles were built to a modified version of the pre-war London Transport design but were similar in appearance to their predecessors.

In total, London Transport received 4,674 post-war RT-class buses between 1947 and 1954, with a small number of similar buses also going to operators outside London’s 

However, the London &quot;RT&quot; family of vehicles could be considered to have numbered 6,956 in total, consisting of 4,825 RTs; 1,631 RTLs and 500 RTWs. The latter two types had a variant of the Leyland Titan chassis and, also, the RTWs had Leyland 8 feet wide steel-framed bodies (as opposed to 7 feet 6 inches). The whole family were never all in operation at the same time. In addition, some surplus bodies were, for a short time, put onto modified STL chassis and classed as SRTs.

The very last RT in service (RT624), now preserved by Ensignbus, operated on route 62 from Barking Garage on 7 April 1979. 

One of the class, RT4712 (NXP997) is preserved at the London Transport Museum. It’s painted gold as received this colour to mark the late Queen’s Golden Jubilee.",2023-03-23 17:09:15,51.512016,-0.121231,https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52768309553_151b804131_m.jpg,Exiled Bhoy no longer in Fife,89656176@N08,photo

At the London Transport Museum is this partial bus, LB02YXC, as an example of a more modern London Bus.

The London Underground 1938 Stock was a London Underground tube stock design. A total of 1,121 cars were built by Metro-Cammell and Birmingham RC&amp;W. An additional 173 cars were added to the fleet by the end of 1953, comprising 91 new builds (the 1949 Tube Stock), 76 conversions from Pre-1938 Tube Stock or 1935 Tube Stock, and six unconverted cars of 1935 Tube Stock and the stock was used on the London Underground until 1988. During their long lives they worked on the Bakerloo, Northern, Piccadilly, East London and Central lines. Ten sets were refurbished and ran on the Isle of Wight as Class 483, making them the oldest passenger rolling stock operating timetabled services on the National Rail network at the time of their withdrawal in January 2021. 

The trains represented a major technical advance, as all the electrical equipment was located under the floor for the first time. All previous tube stock had large equipment compartments behind the driving cabs in motor cars, which reduced the space available for passengers by about a third. To last over 80 years in service is no mean feet and one is preserved and on display in 1970s condition in the London Transport museum.",2023-03-23 17:16:50,51.512066,-0.121200,https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52768309543_65c9fbb9cf_m.jpg,Exiled Bhoy no longer in Fife,89656176@N08,photo

Trolleybus 1253 ran in north and northeast London from March 1939 to April 1961. It is a typical example of the K2 type trolleybus, of which over 150 were constructed by Leyland Motors Ltd. Unlike buses, trolleybuses didn't have a front-mounted engine since power was supplied through long booms attached to the roof that latched onto electric wires suspended from above. The vehicles were known for their quiet and smooth ride, and the interiors were carefully designed to be inviting and comfortable. Many were fitted with their own designs of moquette seating covers. During the late 1950s and early 60s, trolleybuses were withdrawn from service. This was mainly due to the development of motorbuses, which were cheaper and more flexible to operate.

Hasselblad XCD 120mm ƒ3.5 Macro Lens
First shots
London, UK

I'm stunned by the quality of the Hasselblad X2D and XCD 120 Macro lens. The colours are like nothing that I've seen from a camera and the micro-details are extraordinary! 
This image is one of the first test shots on my barely used Hasselblad X2D 100C together with a used Hasselblad XCD 120mm ƒ/3.5 Macro lens. I'm absolutely blown away by the quality and colours of the  few photos that I've already managed to take, but can't wait to go out and take some more. This was a somewhat difficult purchase for me, as I had to sell all of my Leica gear, including my beloved M Monochrom (typ 246) and M-Summicron 50mm (VI), as well as all associated lenses, etc. 
It does however mean, through my lifetime of saving up to buy a Leica and subsequent Leicas that even though I'm now Leica-less, I appreciate and still love the brand but I just can't get away from the fact of the even better quality and colour science of Hasselblad. Incidentally and unfortunately, I had to sell my Hasselblad 503 CW too.
Long live the X2D! Hopefully I've made the right decision and can justify the camera with my art.

Some background from Wikipedia about the theatre which &quot;... was built as one of a pair with the Aldwych Theatre on either side of The Waldorf Hilton, London, both being designed by W. G. R. Sprague. The theatre was opened by The Shubert Organization as the Waldorf Theatre on 22 May 1905, and was renamed the Strand Theatre, in 1909. It was again renamed as the Whitney Theatre in 1911, before again becoming the Strand Theatre in 1913. In 2005, the theatre was renamed by its owners (Delfont Mackintosh Theatres) the Novello Theatre in honour of Ivor Novello, who lived in a flat above the theatre from 1913 to 1951.&quot;",2024-11-25 06:49:59,51.512377,-0.119113,https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/54186360872_2b1296b3a2_m.jpg,Clive G',50576141@N03,photo

Another London shot from the archives.  I'm not sure why this dawn shot of London Bridge, a Thomas Heatherwick designed Routemaster double decker bus and St Pauls Cathedral wasn't uploaded sooner.  I don't often find myself in central London at dawn but this was a rare sunrise from the 2022 Photo24 event.

Some background from Wikipedia about the theatre which &quot;... was built as one of a pair with the Aldwych Theatre on either side of The Waldorf Hilton, London, both being designed by W. G. R. Sprague. The theatre was opened by The Shubert Organization as the Waldorf Theatre on 22 May 1905, and was renamed the Strand Theatre, in 1909. It was again renamed as the Whitney Theatre in 1911, before again becoming the Strand Theatre in 1913. In 2005, the theatre was renamed by its owners (Delfont Mackintosh Theatres) the Novello Theatre in honour of Ivor Novello, who lived in a flat above the theatre from 1913 to 1951.&quot;",2024-11-25 06:49:59,51.512377,-0.119113,https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/54186360872_2b1296b3a2_m.jpg,Clive G',50576141@N03,photo

Another London shot from the archives.  I'm not sure why this dawn shot of London Bridge, a Thomas Heatherwick designed Routemaster double decker bus and St Pauls Cathedral wasn't uploaded sooner.  I don't often find myself in central London at dawn but this was a rare sunrise from the 2022 Photo24 event.

The closed station was the terminus of a short spur of the Piccadilly Line from Holborn, originally called 'Strand' when it opened in 1907. Little used it started restricting services as early as 1917 and finally closed for good in 1994 by which time the line was only operating as a rush hour shuttle. London Transport decided that the cost of replacing the ageing lifts couldn't be justified by the small footfall. 

However, the station has been preserved below ground, including the platform and track plus a working tube train and is regularly used as a filming location. Pre booked guided tours can also be arranged.
