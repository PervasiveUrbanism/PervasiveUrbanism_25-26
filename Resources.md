## 1. Main Software Packages

Please download and install the following software:

### Rhino / Grasshopper

* **Rhino:**
  Rhino 8 and Grasshopper are available through the educational license linked to your UCL account.

* **Plug-ins:**
  Rhino 8 / Grasshopper plug-ins can be found on [Food4Rhino](https://www.food4rhino.com/). Below is a non-exhaustive list of plug-ins we will use:

  * **Elk:** Import data from [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=15/51.5390/-0.0177) into Rhino.
  * **Bison:** Analyze terrain meshes.
  * **Firefly:** Integrate network protocols and Arduino sensors with Grasshopper.
  * **Culebra:** Agent-based simulation.
  * **Pufferfish:** Transformations and morphing tools.
  * **Lunchbox:** Versatile geometry and data utilities.
  * **Heron:** Mapping and geolocation tools.
  * **Human:** Display and visualization components.

### Python

We will use **Python 3.x**, available from the official [Python](https://www.python.org/) website.

* **IDE:**
  We will primarily use **[VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)**, with **[Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)** as an alternative.

  * **[Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/):** Browser-based, easy to start; free with an optional paid tier for more compute.
  * **[VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/):** Requires local Python and libraries. Supports **[GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot)** for AI-assisted code completion (free with your UCL account; highly recommended).

### Graphics Reference

Reference sites for inspiration:

* [**Asset Library**](https://shop.studioinnate.com/product/cyberpunk-asset-pack/)
* [**Gmunk**](https://gmunk.com/OBLIVION-GFX)
* [**Ryoji Ikeda**](https://www.ryojiikeda.com/)
* [**Refik Anadol**](https://refikanadol.com/)

### Adobe

Your UCL account includes an **educational license** for Adobe Creative Cloud. Please install the relevant applications (e.g., Photoshop, Illustrator, After Effects, Premiere Pro) ahead of time.

### Online storage & backup

From experience, groups work most effectively with **shared online storage** (e.g., Dropbox, Google Drive, OneDrive), ensuring everyone has consistent access to the latest files.
UCL provides each student with **100 GB** of cloud storage, which may not be sufficient for all coursework—consider arranging additional space if needed.

Hardware can fail and laptops can be stolen. **Missed submissions due to data loss are not considered valid excuses.** Always ensure your work is securely stored and **regularly backed up**.
Online storage solutions provide peace of mind, as your data remain safe—services like **Dropbox**, for example, allow you to recover accidentally deleted files for up to a year (with an extended recovery option).

Alternatively, a **home-based storage system** such as the [**Synology BeeStation**](https://bee.synology.com/en-us/BeeStation) offers a hybrid setup: local file access at home combined with cloud backup and a sharing system similar to Dropbox.

# 2. Learning Resources

## LinkedIn Learning Foundations RC15

Each student will receive an invite to follow a curated set of LinkedIn Learning tutorials. **The RC15 Foundations learning paths** provide the groundwork for the year. While some topics also appear in the Skills Tutorials, those sessions are compressed — reviewing resources in advance makes the live sessions easier to follow and deepens your understanding.

Some topics are not part of the Skills Tutorials but are **highly valuable**—for example, working effectively in teams, presenting with confidence, or using principles of color and layout in presentations.

### RC15 Foundations 1 – 3D Modelling

Introduces **Rhino** and **Grasshopper** as core modelling tools. Early familiarity lets you focus on design thinking rather than technical hurdles.

### RC15 Foundations 2 – Coding and Physical Computing

Covers **Python** and **Arduino** basics to analyse data, prototype interactions, and connect digital processes with physical devices.

### RC15 Foundations 3 – Visual Communication & Presentation

Focuses on clear, persuasive communication: from design principles to storytelling and teamwork—turning projects into compelling narratives.

*Being familiar with the basics beforehand will make the skills modules smoother to follow.*

## O’Reilly

[O’Reilly](https://www.oreilly.com/) offers books and video tutorials with a strong focus on computing and data. Free for UCL students—excellent for **advanced topics**.

## 4. Additional Software Packages and Web Services

### QGIS

[QGIS](https://qgis.org/en/site/index.html) is a free, open-source GIS for maps, satellite imagery, shapefiles, and databases. It supports many formats and can export DXF/PDF. While predominantly 2D and less polished than some commercial tools (e.g., ArcGIS), RC15 has historically **actively supported QGIS** and can offer help. Many practices favour QGIS after graduation due to its **free license**.

* **Plug-ins** (via QGIS Plugin Manager):

  * **Flickr Metadata Downloader** — Search and download geotagged Flickr images.
  * **MMQGIS** — Hexagon grids, Voronoi, and more.
  * **QuickOSM** — Pull OSM data directly.
  * **TimeManager / Time Series** — Create and export animations.
  * **TravelTime Platform** — Accessibility analyses.
  * **QNEAT3** — Network analysis.

Helpful resources:

* [Patrick Stotz – Mapping 101](https://github.com/PatrickStotz/mapping_101)
* [Gentle Introduction to GIS](https://docs.qgis.org/3.22/en/docs/gentle_gis_introduction/index.html)
* [Training Manual](https://docs.qgis.org/3.22/en/docs/training_manual/index.html)
* [Terrain Analysis](https://docs.qgis.org/2.14/en/docs/training_manual/rasters/terrain_analysis.html)
* [GIS Stack Exchange](https://gis.stackexchange.com/) — for specific questions.

### Sublime Text Editor

[Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) — fast, capable text editor that handles very large files.

### vvvv

[**vvvv gamma**](https://visualprogramming.net/) — powerful visual live-programming environment based on C#. Free for non-commercial use. A major competitor is TouchDesigner (its free tier has some limitations).

Find numerous example files within the vvvv installation. Another great resource is the free course from the [Node Institute (Berlin)](https://thenodeinstitute.org/courses/node20-vvvv-workshop-bundle/). The community is small but supportive—use the forum or the “Element” group for questions.

**vvvv** integrates multiple platforms, including a **game engine (Stride)**, a **2D drawing environment (Skia)**, and various powerful libraries such as **OpenCV**. The built-in game engine provides functionality comparable to **Unity** or **Unreal**, but with a key difference — it can be **seamlessly combined with other libraries and data sources**.

For example, reading an **Arduino signal** inside Unity that controls a **Grasshopper definition**—which in turn modifies geometry in **real-time VR**—is possible but complex in Unity. In **vvvv**, such cross-platform communication can be set up **much more easily**.

Overall, **vvvv** tends to produce **more abstract and experimental graphics**, which align well with the aesthetic and conceptual direction of **RC15**.
 

### Sensor Log

[Sensor Log](http://sensorlog.berndthomas.net/) — iPhone app that turns your phone into a **multi-sensor** device.

### D5

[D5](https://www.d5render.com/) — real-time rendering engine (similar to Enscape/Twinmotion) with educational licenses that unlock all features.

### Mapbox Studio

[Mapbox Studio](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-studio) — design custom map styles; can be used as backgrounds in QGIS. The free tier is generous and sufficient for coursework.
How-to: [Use Mapbox backgrounds in QGIS](https://docs.mapbox.com/help/tutorials/mapbox-arcgis-qgis/).

### Kepler GL

[Kepler GL](https://kepler.gl/) — web-based tool for quick, attractive geo-visualisations; simple, fast, and free. It has a python integration as well.

### Ped Catch

[Ped Catch](http://pedcatch.com/) — generates pedestrian network diagrams that account for slopes; results can be exported to QGIS.

### Google Earth and Google Earth Studio

* [Google Earth](https://earth.google.com) — capture screenshots.
* [Google Earth Studio](https://www.google.com/earth/studio/) — create **flythroughs and animations**; useful for presentations and even 3D point-cloud reconstruction with Autodesk Recap.
